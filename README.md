# 🧠 NanoAgent — A 135M Parameter Agentic SLM

NanoAgent is a **135M parameter**, **8k context length**, open-source language model designed for **agentic tasks** such as **tool calling**, **instruction following**, and **lightweight reasoning**.  
It’s small enough (~135 MB in 8-bit) to run on **edge devices** like personal laptops, low-memory CPUs, and even wearables — yet smart enough to make tool calls, parse web information, and give structured answers.

## 🌍 Real-World Use Cases

- 🕹️ **Runs on edge devices** — laptops, smartwatches, browsers, or CPU-only environments.  
- 🌐 **Parses and answers from the web** — supports tool calling to fetch real-time information.  
- 🔎 **Answers recent questions** with live web search tools.  
- 💬 **Continues conversations** — ideal for assistant or agent frameworks.  
- ⚙️ **Tool calling support** enables chaining multiple tools and parsing results to produce final answers.

## 🧭 Key Explorations & Findings

- ✂️ **Dataset deduplication** significantly improved performance by removing noisy or duplicate Q/As.  
 - ✂️ **Shortening the responses** (casual response) and using shorter python code in training improved performance and reduce repeated token generation.
- 🧮 **Word-level reasoning** from `orca-math` enhanced the model’s ability to handle stepwise logic.  
- 🧰 Designing tool calling prompts using **six open-source tool calling datasets** resulted in stronger structured output generation.  
- 🌐 Tool calling integration enabled the model to **extract answers from parsed web data**, supporting up-to-date queries.
